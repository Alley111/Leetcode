[1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock](https://leetcode.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/description/)

* Each minute angle = 6 (360&deg; / 12 / 5 = 6&deg;) * minutes

* Each hour angle   = (hour % 12) * 30&deg; + minutes/60 * 30&deg;

If the result is obtuse angle, turn to acute angle with 360-result


```
class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:
        m_angle = minutes*6
        h_angle = (hour%12)*30 + minutes*0.5
        angle = abs(m_angle-h_angle)
        # return min(angle, 360-angle)
        return angle if angle<=180 else 360-angle
```



[acute angle, obtuse angle, 10 to the power of negative 5 = 10 raised to the power of negative 5, hour hand, minute hand ]
